## Getting started with Keylime 
The best way to get started is to read the [Keylime
Documentation](https://keylime-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), however if you're keen to get started right away, follow these steps.

To start the Keylime verifier and registrar, you will need to start the following services. 

`# keylime_verifier`

`# keylime_registrar`

To start the Keylime rust agent, navigate to the rust-keylime directory and run the following command.

`# RUST_LOG=keylime_agent=trace cargo run --bin keylime_agent`

You can now set up a use case, a good first scenario to try out would be [IMA
Integrity Monitoring](https://keylime-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/runtime_ima.html)

For more detailed set up scenarios, see the [Keylime
documentation](https://keylime-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/runtime_ima.html)
